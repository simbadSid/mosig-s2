 Riyan's annotations
----------------------------------------------------
-> Don't try to make your work look bigger than it is: "Our objective
is to propose operating system designs to suite the multithreading
paradigm". Even for a phd thesis, that would sound very ambitious,
imagine for a 1-month master internship :). Again, state your goals as
simply as possible.

-> The objective of this sentence it to say that we will create this design.  It is
 to show that at the end of this study, we will indicate which one is
  better than the other (without saying that we created it).
  
  What do you think of this one:
  "Our objective is to compare operating system designs within a multithreaded environment."

General comments on the presentation

* The simpler the better!!
-> "Most modern operating systems allow hosted applications to run
many execution flows concurrently. However, the environment they
provide is not suitable to optimize the efficiency of such
applications."
First, this is a way too complex sentence. Second, you
should avoid (long) sentences in a poster.




-> Try to go directly to your point, with the simplest sentences
   possible




Detailed comments about the content of the poster

* There is no need for an "Introduction" part in a poster. Let's
  simply call it "Context"

* Most of the thinks you wrote as "Objectives" actually belong to the
  context. That's probably why you had trouble writing the
  introduction.

* Exercice: Try to write the objective of your one month internship in
  a single sentence (and not a 20-line sentence ;) ). I don't think
  you need more than that as objective.






------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* Regarding the context, here are a few suggestions:
  + Complex Multi-core processors (here you could add a figure to
  illustrate with several cores, levels of cache, and numa nodes)
    - A large number of cores
    - A deep memory hierarchy
    - Running multi-threaded applications is a challenge
  + Concurrent data structure
    - When a data structure is accessed concurently by many threads,
      it can become a bottleneck
    - Highly optimized thread synchronization algorithms have been
      designed
    - Ex: Several highly concurrent queues (\cite)



------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* Then you could have a section called "Problem" (or another
  equivalent name)
  + Memory allocation can also impact multi-threaded application
  performance
    - The allocator is shared between all threads (contention)
    - The allocator should avoid false sharing (use figure)
    - The allocator should favor locality (use figure)
  + Memory allocation for multicore systems is a hot topic (\cite)
  => Most evaluations of highly concurrent queues assume a perfect
  memory allocator

* Based on that, I let imagine the objectives ...






------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Regarding the rest of the content, I don't really agree with the way
  of presenting. Here it looks like you are designing a new memory
  allocator. Make it clear that you are reviewing existing
  allocators. You can call this part "Existing memory allocators" or
  something like that.
  + Here I don't think you need to go that much into the details as
  you did with figure 4 for instance.

* One more comment about the references. Try to be precise there
  too. Don't cite phd thesis except if you don't have any other
  choice. It's better to cite a paper. (When you cite something, you
  are supposed to have read it into details, i'm almost sure you
  didn't read the phd thesis ;) ). Also, be careful with the order of
  the authors -- this is extremely important -- I'm sure that on all
  our papers D Petrovic was the first author.
