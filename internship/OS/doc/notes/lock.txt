- Goal: improve the performance of the delegation allocation memory model
- Method: Introduce 2 optimizations methods to the delegation allocation:
	* "Local-Spin Backoff": Tune the client spin backoff (which is responsible of processors overhade).
	* Change the store instructions from "ordinary" to "streaming": 
	
- Critical section on a shared object: why "Delegation" better than "lock"	
	* Delegation:  The shared object is always in the cache of the delegation thread
	* Lock solution:  The thread that accesses the CS needs to import the shared object from the memory(cache) of the previous thread:  May 
		generate many RMR
	
- Definitions:
	* RMR: remote memory reference: access to shared variables that involves communication on the interconnection network.
		This request needs more time than a access to a memory in the local cache.  But it may be significantely improved if the network 
		message passing are implemented in hardware.



- Questions:
	* Do we suppose that each memory access involves a memory that is in the cache
	*
