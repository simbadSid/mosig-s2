- Result: hoard: concurrent allocator

- Goal: Handle each of the following performance obstacle:
	1- False sharing (of cache lines)
	2- Memory consumption (for management tasks)
	3- Scalability: aim to the property:  Performance_on(n processor) = Performance_on(1 processor) / n
	4- Low fragmentation

- Method (mapped with the previous methodes):


- Design of hoard :



- Results: (On 11 programs run on 14 processor)
	Improves the solaris efficiency by a factor 60
	Improves the best known allocator efficiency by a factor 18



- Questions:



- Definitions:
	* Blowup: kind of memory fragmentation: is the increase in memory consumption caused when a concurrent allocator
	 reclaims memory freed by the program but fails to use it to satisfy future memory requests

	* False sharing: occurs when multiple processorsshare words in the same cache line without actually sharing data
