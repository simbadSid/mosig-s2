Weak duality theorem:
	For each pair of feasible solutions x of (P) and w of (D),  z = cx ≥ wb = v
Strong duality theorem:
	If (P) has solutions and (D) has solutions, then cx∗ = w∗b
Complementary slackness property:
	x∗ optimal for (P) and w ∗ optimal for (D) verify
	- the slack variable of a constraint of (P) is zero
	or
	- the variable associated with this constraint in w ∗ is zero likewise in the other way round





What is the interest of the three theorems of duality
	- Weak duality: to make the proof of optimality
	- Complementary slackness: to find an optimal solution of the
	dual knowing an optimal solution of the primal
	- Strong duality: guaranties that an optimality proof is feasible (using duality)
